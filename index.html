      <p>Hello there! My name is Jason Strub and welcome to my portfolio site! Here is just a little information about me!</p>

      <p>I am originally a native from the country of Panama, but when I was 3 years old I moved to South Florida, where I would grow up. For my collegiate studies, I would atted the University of Central Florida. I graduated with my Bachelors in Sports and Exercise Science. I currently work as a personal trainer for YouFit Health Clubs. I am looking to add a new skill set in to my "toolbox" and eventually would like to make the career change to becoming a full stack developer.</p>
      
      <p>While I am focused on creating a better future for myself, there are many things outside of school and work that I enjoy. First of, I am an avid outdoorsman, and on my free time you can find me outside somewhere exploring with my beautiful girlfriend Lindsey. I am also an avid fisherman, and have a huge passion for fly fishing! It helps me unwind from a long week and most of the time you can find me exploring the backcountry waters of the Florida east coast. I have also recently taken up golfing. While frustrating, I do enjoy the challenge of the game and look forward to getting better at it!</p>
